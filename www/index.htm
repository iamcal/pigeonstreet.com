<pre>
If you lived in Pigeon Street,
Here are the people you could meet,
Here are the people who would say
Hello, Goodbye, Hello, Goodbye
Every day
 
If you lived in Pigeon Street,
Here are the people you could meet,
Here are the people who would share
the sights, the sounds, the air
Where pigeons beat their wings, wings beat.
Pigeons beat their wings, wings beat
to meet in Pigeon Street
