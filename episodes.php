Mrs Glossop is making some jam. Polly and Molly are helping their mum with the jam jars when they spy Gerald's tropical fish who does not look well at all. Gerald has gone to Mr Macadoo's pet shop to get some medicine. Mr Baskerville is also keen to go and see Mr Macadoo and his dog Watson is a bit under the weather. He lices in skyrise court a block of flats at the 13th floor. the lift is broken - what will he do.<br>
	<br>
	William and his mate Jim come to the rescue. They take mr baskerville and watson down in the window crane. On the way they pick up other bits and bobs for other people trapped by the broken lift. Mrs Baker wants a letter posted. William decides that there is too much work to be done by only a few people so gets one of the pigoens to deliver a message to Bob.

	<br>
	First aired: February 17th, 1981<br>
	<br>
	Gerald spotted a weird light in the sky, and nobody could work out what it was. Mr Jupiter lived at the top of a block of flats, and everyone went up there to look at the light.

	<b>3. Pigeon At Sea</b><br>
	<br>
	First aired: February 24th, 1981<br>
	<br>
	Reg and Gerald finds a pigeon that must be rescued from drowning after trying to swim with the ducks. They take it to Macadoo, who suggests that Mr. Baskerville might be able to talk sense to it. Mr Baskerville succeeds partly - the pigeon no longer thinks it is a duck, it decides to be a seagull instead. Bob, however, gets Clara to take the pigeon to the ocean. After attempting to catch fish in the rough sea, the bird is finally content to be a pigeon.<br>
