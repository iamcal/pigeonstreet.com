	<br>
	Long-distance Clara drives a juggernaught<br>
	way down the motorway<br>
	to the busy port<br>
	Long-distance Clara - nothing's too far away<br>
	Picking up and dropping off, load after load<br>
	<br>
	Long Distance Clara, shifts the gears<br>
	Long Distance Clara, she safely stears<br>
	Long Distance Clara, slams on the brakes<br>
	Long Distance Clara, accelerates<br>
	Long Distance Clara driving round the bend<br>
	Hot dinner waiting at her journeys end<br>
	Long Distance Clara, driving down the road<br>
	Always on time and never late<br>
	<br>
	(spoken)<br>
	Long Distance Clara, well, she could drive,<br>
	across the Sahara....<br>
	<br>
	Pole to pole, east to west<br>
	nothing's too far away<br>
	for Long-distance Clara<br>
